EDUCATION Bachelor of Science in Computer Science & Engineering | 2020-2025 East West University Dhaka Relevant Coursework: Programming, Web design, Data Analysis, Artificial Intelligence Mathematics CGPA: 3.48/4.00 EXPERIENCE 1. University Intern Project | 2024-2025| East West University IoT and Deep Learning-Based Water Quality Moni
ity IoT and Deep Learning-Based Water Quality Monitoring System. This was an internship project for university. It was a smart water quality monitoring system which can determine some of the important parameters in water for fisheries with the help of IoT sensors and the deep learning model predicts the quality of the water 2. Sales Executive|2025| Softvence Agency, Dhaka PROJECTS FIFA WORLD CUP Database: The project was to build a dummy FIFA WORLD CUP 2022 database via Oracle Apex with the help
LD CUP 2022 database via Oracle Apex with the help of SQL. Music Recommendation System: The project was a simple recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The machine learning algorithm was SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). PCB Fault Detection: It was a research-based project to detect the early faults of motherboards of 3 different models of laptops. It can detect the faults via image processing using YOLOv8 model. It is an effective project for sustainability. RESEARCH PUBLICATION
