atabase: The project was to build a dummy FIFA WORLD CUP 2022 database via Oracle Apex with the help of SQL. Music Recommendation System: The project was a simple recommendation system using collaborative filtering. The machine learning algorithm was SVD (Singular Value Decomposition). PCB Fault Detection: It was a research-based project to detect the early faults of motherboards of 3 different models of laptops. It can detect the faults via image processing using YOLOv8 model. It is an effectiv
e processing using YOLOv8 model. It is an effective project for sustainability.
